There's something else that also happens in the video that may go unnoticed at first. This effect is known as perceptual blindness, and is explained by the fact that as we focus on a specific task, our brains tend to filter out information that is irrelevant to that task. However, we don't always know what information is, in fact, essential and what is not - an example of this being when we study. Concentrating on a specific part of a study exercise can lead to relevant information being filtered out.

Fortunately, applying oneself to a given task lessens the occurrence of perceptual blindness. In other words, practice develops one's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information.
